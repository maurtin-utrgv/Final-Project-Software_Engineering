Run Login_page.py to run the application in its entirety

So far the project only has a login page,
    That is, it only so far prompts the user to select a user type: Admin and Assigned User.
     Also has a continue button

     (1) already have the main application/login role selection 
	create a user and save as assined admin or 


(2) after login, need the admin interface 
		where user can create, edit, and delete

			(2a)create a new assignment window

			(2b)edit assignment window
				(2b.1) delete assignment?? as a button? 


view all assignments window (can be in both??)

view assignment details window (ca be in both??)

(3) after login, need the user interface
		where user can only view and update status

		(3a) view button and then subsequent view window

		(3b) update status of assignment as a button and subsequet window 


database setup (at the beginning?? and whichever button user selects just need to call
					the database and write to it in each seperate function)
     Also has a continue button
